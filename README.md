From Lab Manual 3 (Operators Part 2) Homework Questions:

Do Questions 1, 2, 3

Instructions:
Create a C Project and then all eight problems will be done in ONE MAIN FILE of that project, meaning that problems will be written one after the other. Then create a zip file of the project. 

Note: For the sake of convenience, create different variables for each problem so that commenting out some codes does not cause errors. For better understanding, write a comment before the problem so that at least I can identify what problem is represented by the code. For example, when doing Lab Manual 2's Homework Question 1, write "//Homework Question 1 - Lab Manual 2"
